# AssetsProcessor

Assets Processor is a simple tool to process your Xcode image assets.  Since that the plugins are no longer working.

1. Scale 3x images to 2x.
2. Scale 3x or 2x images to 1x if needs.
3. Upscale 2x images to 3x if needs.
4. Rename file names with the name set in image assets.
5. Show all results of every image set after processing.
